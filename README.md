  <p align="center">
    Basic physics simulation for testing collisions with two point masses in two dimensions. 
    <br />

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This was a high school physics class final project. The user is able to simulate basic 2D collisions between two point masses and observe the effects of the law of conservation of momentum.

Was initially developed in CodeSkulptor3, an online Python IDE: https://py3.codeskulptor.org/
The simulation was originally displayed using CodeSkulptor's GUI library, `simplegui`. With the upload to GitHub, I've ported the code into a Python script and replaced `simplegui` with `tkinter`.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To try it out for yourself, 
please clone the project, or download and run the Python file `simulation.py` using `python simulation.py`

OR

follow the link below to run the original simulation:  
[CodeSkulptor3 Link](https://py3.codeskulptor.org/index.html#user310_usvH3PnnvR_22.py)

Extract and run myCraft.exe located in the extracted folder.


<!-- Controls -->
## Controls

1. **Positioning:**
   - Drag a ball by clicking near its solid gray guide circle to set its starting location.

2. **Setting Direction:**
   - In configuration mode (when the button says **START**), click on the solid gray guide circle inside a ball.
   - Then click outside the ball to draw an arrow that indicates the direction the ball will move.

3. **Entering Values:**
   - Use the provided text boxes to enter the desired mass and velocity for each ball.

4. **Starting the Simulation:**
   - Click the **START** button to begin the simulation. The balls will move based on the direction and values you have set.

5. **Resetting the Simulation:**
   - Click the **STOP** button to stop the simulation and reset everything.
